Act as a senior full-stack web developer and UI/UX designer.

Build a PROFESSIONAL, production-quality web application called
“Family Home Expense Tracker”.

⚠️ This must NOT look like a basic demo or tutorial app.
It should look like a modern fintech / budgeting product.

----------------------------------
CORE FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
----------------------------------

1. Custom Monthly Cycle
- Expense cycle is from 11th of current month to 10th of next month
- Automatically detect current cycle
- Carry forward remaining balance to next cycle

2. Family Fund System
- Multiple family members
- Each member has:
  - Name
  - Monthly contribution amount
- Features:
  - Add member
  - Edit member
  - Delete member
  - Auto-recalculate total monthly fund when members change

3. Expense Management
- Add daily expense with:
  - Amount
  - Category / Item (supports Marathi Unicode text)
- Edit existing expense
- Delete expense
- Auto update:

  - Remaining balance
- Persistent storage (IndexedDB or LocalStorage – GitHub Pages compatible)

4. Dashboard & Reports
- Show:
  - Total Fund
  - Total Spent
  - Balance Remaining
- Category-wise totals (grouped view)
- Overspend warning when 90% budget is used
- Export monthly expenses to Excel (CSV)
- Structure code so PDF export can be added later

----------------------------------
UI / UX REQUIREMENTS (VERY IMPORTANT)
----------------------------------

- No plain HTML look

Use:

2. style.css

3. app.js

----------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTES
----------------------------------

- Do NOT make it look like a beginner project
- Think like you are building a real family finance product
- Focus equally on UI polish and logic correctness
- Assume end-users are non-technical family members
- Marathi text input should work naturally via system keyboard

----------------------------------
OUTPUT FORMAT

Provide:
- Full code for index.html
- Full code for style.css
- Full code for app.js
